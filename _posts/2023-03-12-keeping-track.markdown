title: How are government affairs professionals keeping track of what is being voted on at local government public meetings?
---

Government affairs professionals typically keep track of what is being voted on
at local government public meetings by following a few key steps and these
steps are ranked below:

1. Monitor meeting agendas: Government affairs professionals regularly monitor the
agendas for upcoming public meetings posted by local governments because there
may be items being voted on that could affect their business. What’s the best
way to do this? Subscribe to a monitoring service such as [Voterheads.com](https://www.voterheads.com).
Otherwise, the professional would need to ask each local government under their
purview to email them the individual agendas and scan them manually for the
important topics. That’s why subscribing to a monitoring service such as
[Voterheads.com](https://www.voterheads.com) is always the number one choice. It’s worth the small cost to
have a service do all that tracking and filtering for you.

1. Attend the public meetings: This choice really only works for government
affairs professionals who can take the time to attend public meetings in person
or remotely and is usually only cost-effective for professionals whose area of
responsibility consists of one to three local governments. Professionals would
only want to attend the meeting if they saw something on the agenda that would
affect them and couldn’t reach the local officials to discuss the item in
advance of the meeting. So they would still need a way (such as a subscription
service like [Voterheads.com](https://www.voterheads.com)) to give them a heads up in advance. At the
meeting, they can give their input on agenda items that affect them, listen to
the discussion, and get a sense of how the vote is likely to go.

1. Network with local officials: Building relationships with local officials can
also be a valuable way for government affairs professionals to stay informed
about what is being voted on at local government public meetings. By connecting
with officials, they may get a heads up about upcoming votes or have access to
insider information about the decision-making process. Once again, this is
usually cost-effective for professionals responsible for only a handful of
towns and cities. And because local government officials tend to have a
relatively high turnover rate, the government affairs professional will have to
regularly renew those relationships.

1. Follow local news sources: Local news outlets often cover public meetings and
the decisions made by local governments. Government affairs professionals can
stay up to date on what is being voted on by following news sources that cover
local politics. This is choice #4 because it will not necessarily provide a
heads up for items important to the professional. News services tend to cover
“hot topic” items only.

Overall, keeping up to date with local government meetings could require a
combination of various methods…which are all made easier by subscribing to a
service that monitors local government activity (like [Voterheads.com](https://www.voterheads.com)). By
staying informed about local politics, government affairs professionals can
effectively represent their interests and advocate for policies that align with
their goals.
