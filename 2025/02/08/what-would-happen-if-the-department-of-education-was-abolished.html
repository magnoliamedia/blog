                <p>Regardless of your views on the current administration, there’s no question that President Trump has wasted no time in challenging the status quo. The administration’s plans to overhaul the federal government include the shuttering, reimagining, or auditing of some federal programs and organizations. The most recent example? The US Department of Education.</p>

<p>The US Department of Education (ED) as we know it today was established in 1979 when President Jimmy Carter signed an act to split the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare into two separate entities. Its primary functions include establishing and implementing federal financial aid policies (Title I funding, Pell Grants, funding to support students with disabilities, etc.), identifying and highlighting key issues in education, and working to ensure equal access to education across the nation.</p>

<p>Under the 10th Amendment, which empowers states with individual rights, the ED does not determine curricula or standards for public schools. This oversight falls to each state’s Department of Education or, in the case of private institutions, the organization itself. Federal acts like the Every Student Succeeds Act, however, might influence the development of state standards.</p>

<p>If the US Department of Education is eliminated, significant changes would occur across the educational landscape. Changes would most notably include shifts in funding, oversight, and administration, potentially impacting students, schools, and families nationwide.</p>

<p><strong>Federal Funding and Programs</strong>
For K–12 education, schools that receive additional federal funding might face budget shortfalls in an unstable funding environment. Programs like Title I (supporting low-income students) and special education funding under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) would likely shift to block grants managed by states. School districts could theoretically redirect federal funds as they see fit, potentially improving local priorities. While this move would lead to greater autonomy by the states in how funds are allocated and used, critics fear that vulnerable student populations may be made more vulnerable[1].</p>

<p>In higher education, federal student aid programs, including loans and grants, might be reassigned to other agencies, such as the Department of Treasury, or managed at the state level. This reassignment could introduce inconsistencies in distribution or compliance[1].</p>

<p><strong>Education Disparity</strong>
Many fear that without the ED the nation would face a rise in general education disparity. One only has to look at national educational rankings to see that quality of education already varies across the nation, and since most responsibility for education policy, curriculum standards, and testing already falls at the state level, the ED’s absence will likely not intensify it.</p>

<p>Most teacher certification is governed at the state level or overseen by independent boards, such as the National Education Association and National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, so teacher training programs would be unaffected.</p>

<p>The ED does ensure civil rights protections in regard to education. Its subagency, the Office for Civil Rights, which enforces anti-discrimination laws in schools, would likely move to another federal agency, like the Department of Justice, which already has a Civil Rights Division[1].</p>

<p><strong>Oversight and Accountability</strong>
Federal oversight of education equity would diminish, placing greater accountability and responsibility on state governments and schools themselves to battle achievement gaps among socioeconomic groups[2][4].</p>

<p>The ED does have a role in oversight of higher education institutions. For-profit colleges might end up facing less regulation, raising concerns about quality control and potential exploitation of students[5]. States, who already play a part, would bear more responsibility in this regulation.</p>

<p><strong>Research and Data Collection</strong>
The ED’s role in collecting data on schools and disseminating research would either end or be transferred to another entity. A lack of centralized education data could hinder efforts to identify national trends and address systemic issues in education[2][4].</p>

<p><strong>Broader Implications</strong>
While the issue is at the forefront of today’s news, extinguishing the ED is hardly a new idea, with efforts going back to the Reagan administration. Critics of the ED argue that eliminating it could reduce federal bureaucracy, empower states, and foster greater community involvement in educational initiatives. Its proponents emphasize its role in promoting equity, protecting civil rights, and ensuring access to quality education for all students[3][5].</p>

<p>Now is a particularly good time for individuals, companies, and organizations to keep an eye on local school board meeting agendas so they can be aware of potential changes to their schools and participate in those discussions.
